## Revenues

apDAO will earn revenue from a variety of sources, including integrations with partners, revenue sharing structures, and Berachain itself. Further details to be released shortly, and the documentation will be updated accordingly.

## Payments

ApDAO categorizes its accounts payable into three categories:

1. Salaries, which are allocated to Beekeepers and Core Contributors.
2. Grants, which are allocated to integrations, partners, etc.
3. Operational Expenses, such as server hosting fees, and other miscellaneous upkeep costs.

All accounts payable are subject to approval via governance and are maintained with full transparency.

## Treasuries

apDAO currently operates 4 treasuries:

1. Honey Treasury
2. Diamond Paw Treasury
3. Liquid Backing Treasury
4. Growth Treasury

**Honey Treasury:**
This treasury will contain all the Honeycomb and Honey Jar NFTs received as deposits during the apDAO genesis process. The contents of this treasury will remain locked, rapidly decreasing the available supply of Honeycomb and Honey Jar NFTs. In the future, apDAO may consider mechanisms that allow these NFTs to leave the vault, provided that there is a 100% risk free way for apDAO to continue earning value from the deposited NFTs without risking loss of the assets.

**Diamond Paw Treasury:**
This treasury will contain all the tokens received by apDAO from its partner protocols, accompanied by a pledge to never to sell the governance tokens received, instead harvesting the rewards yield and governance benefits obtained. The DAO will also have the ability to decide how to drive this treasury’s strategy. This can be done by providing liquidity or other safe strategies, so long as they remain in compliance with any prerequisites listed in our partner agreements.

**Liquid Backing Treasury:**
This treasury will contain a large portion of the revenue generated by apDAO, which includes but is not limited to strategies such as running the validator or auctions from the auction house. apDAO will create various methods to continuously seed money into this treasury, as the liquidity from this treasury will represent a spot value for apDAO seats, versus solely relying on the lending mechanism. This treasury is designed to continuously expand, thus consistently raising seat values.

**Growth Treasury:**

Rather than the static Liquid Backing Treasury, apDAO may choose to direct some of its income to a Growth Treasury where it can direct further investments in the Berachain ecosystem, exchanging immediate return for the potential of compounding rewards.
