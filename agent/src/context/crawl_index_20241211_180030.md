Apiology: the scientific study of honeybees. Berachain runs deep; a boundless culture variegated by so many individualistic sub-communities; micro clusters; social collectives; memetic circles…it can be hard to fully encompass how each of these groups intersect. In this great coalescence, Berachain conjures forth a cult, and at the core of that cult exists a DAO.
In the observation of the many worker bees that move Berachain, we can slowly decipher what initially appears to be chaotic disorder as a coordinated symphony; orchestrated by a group of individuals, united, in service of the hive.

## What is ApiologyDAO?

ApiologyDAO (apDAO) exists at the financial core of the Berachain ecosystem, functioning as a “hive” that bootstraps cultural and financial liquidity across the many DeFi protocols that live on Berachain. apDAO supports and grows these key protocols by strategically directing the flow of investments and resources to various applications, helping to foster deep integrations and deep liquidity for Berachain. Like bees, apDAO pollinates across the application layer, all for the strategic benefit of the hive. As a member of apDAO, you directly gain the ability to help shape and influence a crucial component of Berachain’s largest DeFi protocols.

## Why join apDAO?

apDAO offers members the opportunity to direct apDAO treasuries and gain financial returns by participating in a matrix of many protocols on Berachain. Joining apDAO is akin to unlocking the secrets of the hive. The more you engage with Berachain and explore its cult / culture, the closer you become to uncovering the true value hidden within apDAO. apDAO extends one level higher beyond simply participating in the Berachain community or ecosystem; instead apDAO embodies collaborative effort to direct collective financial resources across Berachain and allow its members to receive the rewards of these activities. As such, apDAO’s membership comprises knowledgeable and influential ecosystem participants from all backgrounds, coming together in synergy to direct resources and leverage apDAO’s unique position at the core of Berachain.

## How was apDAO created?

apDAO is a DAO incubated by [The Honey Jar](https://www.0xhoneyjar.xyz), for the benefit of the entire Berachain ecosystem. Its genesis was driven by devoted Honeycomb NFT (the premier perks aggregator for Berachain) holders seeking to combine the weight of their holdings to direct greater influence across Berachain. apDAO is the physical manifestation of the [Fat Bera Thesis](https://0xhoneyjar.mirror.xyz/nQE-5CbhhirIeTJi7w48P97Ir0-HISuvb6NnwHr-eSA) flywheel. In short, the leading thesis which inspired apDAO’s creation describes that protocols with endogenous apps capture value and share with exogenous protocols, apps, (and the cult) will become prosperous zones of power in DeFi. apDAO leverages long-term alignment to compound its resources and help foster long-term growth for the Berachain ecosystem.
