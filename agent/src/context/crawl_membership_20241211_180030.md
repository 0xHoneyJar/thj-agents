## How to Join apDAO

apDAO Genesis will be a 420-hour-long period in which prospective members will need to collect 7 THJ NFTs (one from each collection), and then deposit a completed set of 7 NFTs into the DAO Treasury. Each group of 7 deposited NFTs (representing a set) corresponds to 1 seat on the DAO. Members can deposit multiple sets to receive multiple seats.

The NFT collections required to join apDAO are:

1. Honey Comb (Ethereum): [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/honey-comb-2)
2. Honey Jar Gen 1 (Ethereum): [Mint](https://app.0xhoneyjar.xyz/mint/berasvsapes)
3. Honey Jar Gen 2 (Arbitrum): [Mint](https://app.0xhoneyjar.xyz/mint/miladysandberas)
4. Honey Jar Gen 3 (Zora): [Mint](https://app.0xhoneyjar.xyz/mint/pudgyfrens)
5. Honey Jar Gen 4 (Optimism): [Mint](https://app.0xhoneyjar.xyz/mint/triforcebees)
6. Honey Jar Gen 5 (Base): (not yet minting)
7. Honey Jar Gen 6 (Ethereum): (not yet minting)

apDAO consists of a total of 5,898 seats. 3,232 have already been pre-allocated to MijaniDAO, THJ, and partners, leaving 2,666 seats remaining for the Genesis period, distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.

DAO seats are non-transferrable and designed for long-term commitment, a structure that will help foster a dedicated group of members focused on the long-term success of the DAO. After the Genesis period, the only way to join apDAO is to buy a seat at auction.

## Benefits of Membership

Members of apDAO are entitled to various financial and community-based incentives and rewards. Where Honeycomb ownership represents a passive aggregation of perks and rewards for its holders, apDAO membership represents active participation in the DAO, including influence over its investments and resources through governance. The following

**Revenue Sharing:** As apDAO invests in protocols across Berachain, members share in the revenues earned by the DAO’s treasuries. This includes additional rewards gained from the supercharged honeycomb deposited by DAO members.

**Governance Rights:** apDAO Members vote and influence apDAO’s governance, allowing each member to have shared control in the decisions and opportunities made by apDAO, including internal DAO decisions, Berachain BGT vault voting, Beradrome vault voting, protocol governance voting, and more. This level of control shapes both the future of apDAO and the broader Berachain ecosystem.

**Community Perks:** apDAO Members receive additional perks through Supercharged Honeycomb, the premier way to access rewards across Berachain. “Supercharged Honeycomb” refers to the deposit Honeycomb used to join the DAO, and the additional compounded rewards and financial benefits one receives by being a DAO member. As Honeycomb is the entry point to Berachain’s ecosystem, many protocols direct their incentives to its holders. apDAO, being the largest collective holder, receives the most significant rewards. apDAO members form the core of Berachain, supporting protocols and operating as the fiscal counterpart to THJ’s Cult-as-a-Service thesis. A seat in apDAO offers long term alignment, influence, and direct financial participation in the ecosystem.
